Landing-Page-Project
My 3rd challenge in the freecampcode projects for Front-end Development.

The Challenge:

View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
See hover states for interactive elements
Use Media Queries
Use Flexbox


Process

Built with
VScode
Semantic HTML5 markup
CSS custom properties

What I learned Being that I'm still learning frontend development, I was able work on a few things for the first time and understand them properly. Some of the CSS properties were:

How to use Flexbox
Mixing units and using them at the appropriate time
Adding media queries
More knowledge on divs, their height and width
how to also use psuedo-classes and hover states

There are still other things i need to learn and I'll still need to keep practicing.
